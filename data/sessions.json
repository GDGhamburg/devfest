If we miss our 60fps goal, interacting with websites and -apps can become pure pain - especially on mobile. In this talk I will first explain in short how browsers turn our code into pixels each frame. And with the help of Chrome's DevTools we will make scrolling and transitions jank free without giving up our eye candy features e.g. fixed header, off-canvas menu and parallax scrolling. Let’s create some fancy rich but silky smooth stick-to-finger user experiences!",

This talk shows the potential of the web with its APIs as it is today and the potential it may unleash in the future. The APIs will be demonstrated with a lot of code samples, demo applications and several use-cases from the real world.",

    "description": "The slogan '#PERFMATTERS' by Colt McAnlis is one of the most important statements, which an Android developer should follow. A well performing application makes the difference between a nice looking application and one, which gets successful. You, as an Android developer, have the responsibility to delight your users, so they don't feel how much work your application has to burden to fulfill the user's needs. This session will show you some easy optimizations and how to avoid glitches in the application. A lot of developers would shout, that this is premature optimization. In contrary it is preventive. With a small amount of work while developing you can avoid a lot of pitfalls. You will hopefully have a better understanding of the underlying system afterwards. During the session some tools and frameworks will be presented for helping you to fulfill your mission.",

Building a server enterprise application which is highly scalable with high and reliable availability in addition to great performance which consists of set of independent deployable oriented services can be achieved by Microservice architecture.

    "description": "Automated Testing nowadays is an essential part of software development and is getting increasingly popular in mobile development. Automating unit tests is quite common these days, however automated UI testing  provides you with more reasonable test results, since it is performed on the same user interface your daily user is confronted with. Integrating automated UI testing into your daily business enables you to detect problems in software early on, which provides you with permanent control over an ongoing development process. Furthermore automated UI testing allows you to speed up your development cycle which will lead to swifter detection of regressions in development and therefore helps to lower the overall cost of software development. This session aims to introduce the audience to the field of automated testing by giving a short overview of this particular subject and some useful tools. It takes a critical look at the status quo, the benefits and possible complications of automated testing.",

Due to “Responsive Design” there are high efforts on this kind of stuff.<br><br>Sure it’s possible to calculate the delta between images to ensure that the layout does not differ between the last checks. But especially when you build up a new application or start a new design this approach doesn’t really work out. Here comes the Galen Framework to the rescue: Describe like in TDD you’re requirements in a DSL and let the framework verify it for you. The Galen DSL uses relations between elements to describe your checks. For test execution the Selenium automation stack is used. So you can even utilize Saucelabs. And the  Galen Framework can be used in Java– und JavaScript projects. Additionally Galen delivers impressive reports for analyzing the failures.",
