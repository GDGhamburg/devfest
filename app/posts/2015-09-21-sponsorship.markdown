### What is a DevFest?
GDG DevFests are large, community-run events that can offer speaker sessions across multiple product areas, all-day hack-a-thons, code labs, and more. They are usually organized by the local Google Developer Groups (GDG). In 2015, the official DevFest Season runs from September 1st through November 30th. https://developers.google.com/events/devfest/  

### The DevFest Hamburg 2015
We, the GDGs of Hamburg (GDG Android, GDG Go and GDG Web) plan to host a Devfest in Hamburg from 5 - 6 November.

For the first time the location will be the Betahaus Hamburg, which marks a significant growth compared to last year. After the [first DevFest Hamburg](http://gdghamburg.github.io/DevFest14/) with 100 people at Xing last year, we expect up to 275 attendees spread over 2 days, 9 codelabs and 12 presentation sessions on 2 parallel running stages. 

We prepared some possible packages for you that you can choose to support this big endeavor of the developer community in Hamburg. While we mention all sponsors, some packages give you also the opportunity to present yourself to our attendees.

**Important note:** The Devfest Hamburg is a pure community effort without any financial gain for the organizer team. The goal is to exchange knowledge and bring the developers community from Hamburg together. Therefore all of the support will be used completely for the improvement of the event or subsequent community events in Hamburg!
